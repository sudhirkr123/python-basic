Raksha Bandhan is an Indian festival celebrated famously in the religion of Hinduism. This festival earmarks
harmony and peace among the different religions in India. During British Raj, Rabindranath Tagore sought
the medium of rakhi to cease the partition of Bengal. In Hindu mythology, this ritual was observed by
various gods. Sachi, the wife of Lord Indra, tied a pious bracelet to protect her husband from the powerful
evil king Bali. People from other communities also celebrate it and have named it Avani Avattam and Kajari
Purnima Raksha Bandhan is a famous festival celebrated in India by the Hindu community. According to the lunar
calendar, this festival is observed on the day of the full moon in July or August. On this auspicious day, the
brothers take an oath to protect their sisters from anything or anyone of harmful. Even the cousins and
brothers believed by heart can pronounce their promise to look after their sisters. The sisters worship their
brothers and then tie a band on their wrist to strengthen the oath, and in return, they receive a gift from their
brothers.Rakhi symbolizes the love and harmony, but if we study the Hindu mythology, we understand that rakhi was
not only performed by brothers and sisters. In the legendary myth of Lord Indra Dev and Sachi, Lord Indra
went on a fierce battle with a powerful demonic king Bali. This prolonged battle was not coming to a
conclusion, and in fear of the threatened life of Lord Indra, his wife Sachi tied a pious bracelet to his wrist
that was given to her by Lord Vishnu. Thus, in ancient times the tying of thread has become a tradition for
married couples, but in the present time, it has extended from brothers and sisters to every kind of relationship.
Happy Raksha Bandhan.
